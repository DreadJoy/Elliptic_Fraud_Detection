## 🚩 Flagship Project

### [Elliptic Bitcoin Transaction Fraud Detection](https://github.com/DreadJoy/Elliptic_Bitcoin_Fraud_Detection)

> _Bridging mathematics and data science to uncover hidden fraud rings in Bitcoin transactions._

- **Graph Theory & Topology:** Degree stats, centralities, PageRank, clustering, cycles, Betti numbers, persistent homology.
- **Machine Learning:** Logistic regression, random forest, neural networks, ensemble strategies.
- **Results:** Perfect separation (AUC = 1.00), interpretable probabilities, and visual insights into fraud "neighborhoods."
- **Why it matters:** Fraud detection is my passion—this project blends my favorite mathematical fields with practical impact.
